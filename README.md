# Filta FE

## Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Vite

## Accessibility considerations

- I've wrapped all the clickable items into an anchor tags for best practice
- Added necessary image alt tags
- Each clickable element can be accessed through using tabs

## Responsive design considerations

- I've used `767px` as my reference for mobile viewports
- Added srcSet for image retina versions
- Created CSS variables for reusability

## Animation

- Simple link hover animation
- Modal zoom in transition
- Blog image zoom in on hover
